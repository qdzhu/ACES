    "As you learned this morning, satellite-based data sets are an invaluable resource to atmospheric scientists, with numerous applications in a variety of subdisciplines. Wildfires, for example, are excellent candidates for remote sensing in that they begin without warning and are particularly dangerous to monitor via in situ techniques. Today you will explore some recent wildfire events from space using NASA’s \"[Worldview](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/)\" data visualizer application, an expansive collection of fully processed and publicly available global satellite data.\n"
